Effective Phishing Detection Using ML â€“ The machine learning model  accurately detects phishing URLs by analyzing key features from URLs  and webpage content. It provides automated, fast, and reliable  classification, improving cybersecurity protection
Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat where attackers deceive
 users into revealing sensitive information. This project aims to detect phishing
 attempts using machine learning by analyzing email, URL, and website
 features. Machine learning models learn patterns from phishing and
 legitimate data to improve detection accuracy. Unlike traditional rule-based
 methods, these models adapt to evolving attack strategies. This approach
 enhances cybersecurity by providing automated, real-time phishing
 detection
